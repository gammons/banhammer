# banhammer

Banhammer is a roguelike game that is currently under active development.  It's going to feature the following:

* High fantasy
* Low fantasy
* Roguelike-ness 
* Humor

Banhammer is based upon libgdx and Java.  It's not that I have a particular affinity to Java (I don't), but I do intend to release Banhammer on IOS and android, and therefore need to use a well-documented, cross-platform tool.

Banhammer's developement will be completely open source.

If you wish to follow along with a true blow-by-blow of banhammer's development, follow the tutorial video series, where I talk about the decisions I am making when developing the game.
